# 💳 Secure Digital Wallet

A modern, secure, and user-friendly **Digital Identity and Document Verification System** built with React, MUI, and blockchain-inspired design principles. This platform empowers users with **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, ensuring privacy, transparency, and control over their digital credentials.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
Users fully own and control their digital identities using decentralized wallets and cryptographic proofs.

### 🎯 Zero-Knowledge Verification
Prove essential attributes (like age or qualifications) without revealing sensitive personal data.

### ⛓️ Blockchain-Inspired Integrity
Tamper-proof verification records and encrypted storage via decentralized technologies like IPFS and AES-256.

### 📄 Verifiable Credentials
Trusted issuers (colleges, governments, etc.) issue digital credentials stored securely and verified cryptographically.

## 🧠 Core Problems Addressed

- **Lack of Legal IDs** — Millions are unable to access essential services due to lack of documentation.
- **Centralized Vulnerabilities** — Traditional systems are prone to corruption and single points of failure.
- **No Data Control** — Users have minimal control over how their data is stored or shared.
- **Digital Exclusion** — Marginalized communities are often left behind in ID-based systems.
